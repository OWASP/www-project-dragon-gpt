## Example

In the example below we have a very simple architecture where a user interacts with a web client, the web client sends HTTP requests to the server and the server makes queries to an SQL database. The Dragon-GPT creates a list of sentences, describes the diagram based on the JSON file created by OWASP THreat Dragon, and uses it as input to the LLM, which can be the ChatGPT or a local LLM.
